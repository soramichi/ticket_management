# Ticket management

## Issues tackled in this app
- Sometimes you mistakenly forget to pay for concert tickets you've won, which will result in serious situations:
  - You loose a greate chance you've got
  - You will loose future opporunities to win ticket lotteries (that's many FCs do, you know) 
- Now you've paid for a hanful of tickets, but here's another problem:
  - You will give one ticket for concert A to John.
  - Because John will give one ticket for concert B to Sara, it will be Sara (not John) to give the money to you.
  - Oops, John caught a fulu 2 days before the concert, so he asked you to give the ticket to Mark, who's actually not a direct friend of you.
  - Cool, so now who owes what to who??

We need a management tool to tackle these problems.
